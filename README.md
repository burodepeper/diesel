A simple 2d, particle-based (game) engine using web-technology.

## Work in progress

Currently in the process of being rewritten to become open-source. Current content should all be considered temporary, but feel free to follow the progress.

## Examples

### 1) Bouncing particles

A 4:3 canvas is divided in three columns, and each column is populated with 40 randomly bouncing particles. [link](examples/01-bounce/index.html)
