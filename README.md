# Diesel

A sketchpad for interactive ideas; a Javascript/canvas based game-engine.

**Work in progress...**

## Introduction

In contrary to many other tools, the emphasis in **Diesel** is intentionally kept away from the logic and complexity of programming on one hand, and the patience and skill required for creating stunning graphics on the other. Instead, it helps you focus on _what_ you are making; gameplay. **Diesel** provides a set of tools that allow you to quickly create interactive awesomeness. In **Diesel** you will be defining how different elements behave, towards each other or within a context, and all the programming involved will be done _for_ you.

However, don't let the retro, pixelated look-and-feel fool you into thinking you can't create stunningly beautiful works of art with this engine. **Diesel** is open-source, and the tools it provides can be easily extended to create your own. Once you've got the basics figured out, you can delve into the inner workings of the engine (which are surprisingly simple) to harnass its full potential.
